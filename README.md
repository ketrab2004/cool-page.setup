## Setup:

1. Replace cool-page-setup in different files, depending on how your host does stuff
   * .htaccess
      - RewriteBase
      - RewriteRule
   * ./php/classes/services/PageService.php
      - protected const baseUrl

2. Replace database connection info
   * in ./php/classes/services/DatabaseService.php

3. Make a website üòÅ

### Visual Studio Code setup:
1. Check if the correct files/folders are hidden (for example .vscode and .idea)
2. Check if live sass compiler compiles to the correct directory (```style/css/```) by making a new scss file in ```style/scss/```

### PhpStorm setup:
1. In the project explorer choose the ```Default``` scope
   - Check if the correct files/folders are hidden (for example .idea and .vscode)
2. Turn on the scss file watcher, if it doesn't exist import it from ```.idea/file_watchers/watchers.xml```
   - Check if the file watcher compiles to the correct directory (```style/css```)

## Usage:

### Controllers:
Controllers basically "control" the website.
They call upon services and use them, then store the resulting data for pages to display.
Variables should not be defined in controllers, but instead inside models that the controller extends.

### Models:
Models hold all the variable definitions for controllers.
They also hold all the getter and setter methods for these variables.

### Services:
Services provide services that controllers (or maybe sometimes pages themselves) can use.
<i>Like in Roblox üôÇ</i>

### Pages:
Pages create and use controllers to fill themselves with content.
